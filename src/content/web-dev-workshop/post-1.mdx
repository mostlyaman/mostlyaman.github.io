Welcome to the Web Developement Workshop. This workshop is designed to get you started with basic web technologies and enable you to learn new things on your own. 

### Why learn Web Development?

By being familiar in web technologies, you can:

#### 1. Make original projects
Instead of copying projects from the internet to put on your resume, you can create unique apps which solve specific issues pertaining to you. This gives you a massive edge in company interviews and builds your portfolio.

#### 2. Apply for Paid Internships
There is a unlimited demand for beginner software developer interns on job platforms like LinkedIn and Wellfound. Whether you are interested in doing a internship or not, never agree to work for free for someone.

#### 3. Start Freelancing
Web Development is one of the most popular categories in freelancing marketplaces like Upwork. Within 2 months of guided practice, you can start looking for simple projects like web scraping and creating dashboards. Once you are comfortable with the basics, it is time to learn advanced libraries and frameworks and start looking for bigger projects which can range from $200 to $1000 dollars.

### What can you expect in this course?
You cannot learn web development in a single course. However, this course will help you understand the basics and start learning on your own. By the end of this course, you will be able to create a simple **GOOD LOOKING** website with minor functionalities. 

We will be recreating a simplified version of the beautiful web interface of <a href="https://any.do"  target="_blank">Any.do</a>, a multi million dollar startup creating powerful tools to manage tasks.
